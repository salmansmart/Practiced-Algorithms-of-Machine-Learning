    "- This data is crude and is known as raw data.\n",
    "- It may contain missing values, unstructured data, incorrect inputs, and outliers.\n",

    "- If we directly use this raw, un-processed data to train our models, we will land up with a model having a very poor efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus Feature Engineering plays an extremely pivotal role in determining the performance of any machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing The Dataset Features iis very important,\n",
    "- Whenever you get your hands on a dataset, you must first spend some time analyzing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This will help you get an understanding of the type of features and data you are dealing with.\n",
    "- Analyzing the dataset will also help you create a mind map of the feature engineering techniques that you will need to process your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now our dataset is feature engineered and all ready to be fed into a Machine Learning model.\n",
    "- This dataset can now be used to train the model to make the desired predictions.\n",
    "- We have effectively engineered all our features.\n",
    "- The missing values have been handled, the categorical variables have been effectively encoded and the features have been scaled to a uniform scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rest assured, now we can safely sit back and wait for our data to generate some amazing results!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have effectively feature engineered all the variables in your dataset, you can be sure to generate models having the best possible efficiency as all the algorithms can now perform to their optimum capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering, like so many things in data science, is an iterative process. Investigating, experimenting, and doubling back to make adjustments are crucial.\n",
    "- The insights you stand to gain into the structure of your data and the potential improvements to model performance are usually well worth the effort.\n",
    "- Plus, if you’re relatively new to all this, feature engineering is a great way to practice working with and manipulating DataFrames! So stay tuned for future posts covering specific examples (with code) of how to do just that.\n",

    "- This is a simple way to check whether you need to investigate certain data points before using more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using visualizations\n",
    "- You can use software to visualize your data with a box plot, or a box-and-whisker plot, so you can see the data distribution at a glance. This type of chart highlights minimum and maximum values (the range), the median, and the interquartile range for your data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- You can convert extreme data points into z scores that tell you how many standard deviations away they are from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a value has a high enough or low enough z score, it can be considered an outlier. As a rule of thumb, values with a z score greater than 3 or less than –3 are often determined to be outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the interquartile range\n",
    "- The interquartile range (IQR) tells you the range of the middle half of your dataset. You can use the IQR to create “fences” around your data and then define outliers as any values that fall outside those fences.\n",

    "- Identify the first quartile (Q1), the median, and the third quartile (Q3).\n",

    "- Calculate your lower fence = Q1 – (1.5 * IQR)\n",
    "- Use your fences to highlight any outliers, all values that fall outside your fences.\n",

    "- Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model.\n",
    "- It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.\n",
    "- When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The steps used in data preprocessing include the following:\n",
    "- Data profiling\n",
    "- Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing and reviewing data to collect statistics about its quality.\n",
    "- Data cleansing.\n",
    "- Data reduction.\n",
    "- Data transformation.\n",
    "- Data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preprocessing transforms the data into a format that is more easily and effectively processed in data mining, machine learning and other data science tasks.\n",
    "- The techniques are generally used at the earliest stages of the machine learning and AI development pipeline to ensure accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are several different tools and methods used for preprocessing data, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sampling, which selects a representative subset from a large population of data;\n",
    "- transformation, which manipulates raw data to produce a single input;\n",
    "- denoising, which removes noise from data;\n",
    "- imputation, which synthesizes statistically relevant data for missing values;\n",
    "- normalization, which organizes data for more efficient access; and\n",
    "- feature extraction, which pulls out a relevant feature subset that is significant in a particular context.\n",
    "- These tools and methods can be used on a variety of data sources, including data stored in files or databases and streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is data preprocessing important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning and deep learning algorithms work best when data is presented in a format that highlights the relevant aspects required to solve a problem.\n",
    "- Feature engineering practices that involve data wrangling, data transformation, data reduction, feature selection and feature scaling help restructure raw data into a form suited for particular types of algorithms.\n",
    "- This can significantly reduce the processing power and time required to train a new machine learning or AI algorithm or run an inference against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data preprocessing techniques\n",
    "- There are two main categories of preprocessing -- data cleansing and feature engineering. Each includes a variety of techniques, as detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data cleansing\n",
    "- Techniques for cleaning up messy data include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and sort out missing data.\n",
    "- There are a variety of reasons a data set might be missing individual fields of data.\n",
    "- Data scientists need to decide whether it is better to discard records with missing fields, ignore them or fill them in with a probable value.\n",
    "- For example, in an IoT application that records temperature, adding in a missing average temperature between the previous and subsequent record might be a safe fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce noisy data. Real-world data is often noisy, which can distort an analytic or AI model.\n",
    "- For example, a temperature sensor that consistently reported a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit might erroneously report a temperature as 250 degrees.\n",
    "- A variety of statistical approaches can be used to reduce the noise, including binning, regression and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify and remove duplicates. When two records seem to repeat, an algorithm needs to determine if the same measurement was recorded twice, or the records represent different events.\n",
    "- In some cases, there may be slight differences in a record because one field was recorded incorrectly.\n",
    "- In other cases, records that seem to be duplicates might indeed be different, as in a father and son with the same name who are living in the same house but should be represented as separate individuals.\n",
    "- Techniques for identifying and removing or joining duplicates can help to automatically address these types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature engineering\n",
    "- Feature engineering, as noted, involves techniques used by data scientists to organize the data in ways that make it more efficient to train data models and run inferences against them.\n",
    "- These techniques include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature scaling or normalization. Often, multiple variables change over different scales, or one will change linearly while another will change exponentially.\n",
    "- For example, salary might be measured in thousands of dollars, while age is represented in double digits.\n",
    "- Scaling helps to transform the data in a way that makes it easier for algorithms to tease apart a meaningful relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data reduction.\n",
    "- Data scientists often need to combine a variety of data sources to create a new AI or analytics model.\n",
    "- Some of the variables may not be correlated with a given outcome and can be safely discarded.\n",
    "- Other variables might be relevant, but only in terms of relationship -- such as the ratio of debt to credit in the case of a model predicting the likelihood of a loan repayment; they may be combined into a single variable.\n",
    "- Techniques like principal component analysis play a key role in reducing the number of dimensions in the training data set into a more efficient representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discretization.\n",
    "- It's often useful to lump raw numbers into discrete intervals.\n",
    "- For example, income might be broken into five ranges that are representative of people who typically apply for a given type of loan.\n",
    "- This can reduce the overhead of training a model or running inferences against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature encoding.\n",
    "- Another aspect of feature engineering involves organizing unstructured data into a structured format.\n",
    "- Unstructured data formats can include text, audio and video.\n",
    "- For example, the process of developing natural language processing algorithms typically starts by using data transformation algorithms like Word2vec to translate words into numerical vectors.\n",
    "- This makes it easy to represent to the algorithm that words like \"mail\" and \"parcel\" are similar, while a word like \"house\" is completely different.\n",
    "- Similarly, a facial recognition algorithm might reencode raw pixel data into vectors representing the distances between parts of the face."

    "- Ordinal encoding is similar to label encoding but allows you to explicitly define the mapping between categories and integer labels.\n",
    "- This is especially useful when there is a clear and predefined ordinal relationship.\n",
    "- You manually specify the order of categories and map them to integers accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, we use the OrdinalEncoder class from category_encoderslibrary.\n",
    "- This library provides a convenient way to apply various encoding techniques to your categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with a DataFrame df containing an ordinal categorical column 'Education_Level' with values like 'High School,' 'Bachelor's,' and 'Master's.'\n",
    "- We define the order of categories in the education_order list. The order should match the ordinal relationship of the categories.\n",
    "- We initialize the OrdinalEncoder with the specified mapping using the mapping parameter.\n",
    "- We provide a dictionary specifying the column to encode ('Education_Level') and a mapping dictionary that maps each category to its ordinal value based on the defined order.\n",
    "- We fit and transform the DataFrame using the ordinal_encoder.\n",

    "- Feature scaling is the process of normalizing the range of features in a dataset.\n",
    "- Real-world datasets often contain features that are varying in degrees of magnitude, range, and units. Therefore, in order for machine learning models to interpret these features on the same scale, we need to perform feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling of the data comes under the set of steps of data pre-processing when we are performing machine learning algorithms in the data set.\n",
    "- As we know most of the supervised and unsupervised learning methods make decisions according to the data sets applied to them and often the algorithms calculate the distance between the data points to make better inferences out of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In real life, if we take an example of purchasing apples from a bunch of apples, we go close to the shop, examine various apples and pick various apples of the same attributes.\n",
    "- Because we have learned about the attributes of apples and we know which are better and which are not good also we know which attributes can be compromised and which can not.\n",
    "- So if most of the apples consist of pretty similar attributes we will take less time in the selection of the apples which directly affect the time of purchasing taken by us.\n",
    "- The moral of the example as if the apples every apple in the shop is good we will take less time to purchase or if the apples are not good enough we will take more time in the selection process which means that if the values of attributes are closer we will work faster and the chances of selecting good apples also strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly in the machine learning algorithms if the values of the features are closer to each other there are chances for the algorithm to get trained well and faster instead of the data set where the data points or features values have high differences with each other will take more time to understand the data and the accuracy will be lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So if the data in any conditions has data points far from each other, scaling is a technique to make them closer to each other or in simpler words, we can say that the scaling is used for making data points generalized so that the distance between them will be lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we know, most of the machine learning models learn from the data by the time the learning model maps the data points from input to output.  \n",
    "- And the distribution of the data points can be different for every feature of the data.\n",
    "- Larger differences between the data points of input variables increase the uncertainty in the results of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The machine learning models provide weights to the input variables according to their data points and inferences for output. -  - In that case, if the difference between the data points is so high, the model will need to provide the larger weight to the points and in final results, the model with a large weight value is often unstable.\n",
    "- This means the model can produce poor results or can perform poorly during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling the target value is a good idea in regression modelling; scaling of the data makes it easy for a model to learn and understand the problem.\n",
    "- In the case of neural networks, an independent variable with a spread of values may result in a large loss in training and testing and cause the learning process to be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalization and Standardization are the two main methods for the scaling of the data. Which are widely used in the algorithms where scaling is required.\n",
    "- Both of them can be implemented by the scikit-learn libraries preprocess package.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Normalization can have various meanings, in the simplest case normalization means adjusting all the values measured in the different scales, in a common scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In statistics, normalization is the method of rescaling data where we try to fit all the data points between the range of 0 to 1 so that the data points can become closer to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a very common approach to scaling the data.\n",
    "- In this method of scaling the data, the minimum value of any feature gets converted into 0 and the maximum value of the feature gets converted into 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basically, under the operation of normalization, the difference between any value and the minimum value gets divided by the difference of the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "- We can represent the normalization as follows :\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "- Like normalization, standardization is also required in some forms of machine learning when the input data points are scaled in different scales. Standardization can be a common scale for these data points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The basic concept behind the standardization function is to make data points centred about the mean of all the data points presented in a feature with a unit standard deviation.\n",
    "- This means the mean of the data point will be zero and the standard deviation will be 1.\n",
